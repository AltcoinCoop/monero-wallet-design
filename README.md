# Monero Wallet Design proposal

UI design proposal for the official wallet for the Monero cryptocurrency. This came out of a quick, just-for-fun restyling of the wallet, but hopefully it can turn into something bigger with the help of you and other designers and developers. After all, Monero is badass softare and deserves a badass interface.
